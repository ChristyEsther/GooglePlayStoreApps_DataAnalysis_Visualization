# GooglePlayStoreApps_DataAnalysis_Visualization
A wholesome Data Analysis and Data visualizaton created for Google Apps store dataset to find the top app categories and the variables that contribute to it.
I harnessed the power of Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries to conduct a comprehensive data analysis. By employing these tools, 
I efficiently cleaned, processed, and manipulated the dataset to extract valuable insights. 
The combination of Pandas' flexible data structures and NumPy's numerical computations facilitated seamless data handling and transformation. 
Additionally, I utilized Tableau for data visualization, creating interactive and informative dashboards that showcased key trends, 
user behavior, and app performance metrics. This multi-faceted approach allowed me to uncover patterns, correlations, and user preferences 
within the Google Apps Store dataset, enabling data-driven decision-making and offering a holistic view of the app ecosystem.
